// page falls back to the inline list plus the floating pill. The breakpoint,
// 780px, is low enough that the default window and Houdini's help pane both
// get the side list: the column narrows to make room rather than lose it to
// an inline list above the fold. Page.tsx, FloatingPill and readingLine use
// the same number.
//
// The measure is the READING COLUMN's own width, not the window's. The window
// carries a panel down its left side that the reader can drag or hide, so a
// window-width breakpoint puts the gutter list on a page that has no room for
// it and the article scrolls sideways. Every breakpoint class below is written
// out in full: Tailwind scans source text, so a class assembled from a
