/**
 * Node/tool icons come from `icons.zip` through the `hicon` protocol. An icon
 * already loaded once shows on the first paint; `warmRows` loads the sidebar's
 * next rows while their page is read. A new one stays hidden until it
 * loads: Chromium draws its broken-image glyph for a missing icon a frame or
 * more before the error event, so a visible new icon flashed that glyph. A slow
 * image shows a delayed skeleton, then fades over it. An icon the zip does not
 * hold renders the caller's fallback, and is never asked for again.
 *
 * Intrinsic size means nothing here: many SideFX icons carry a `viewBox` and no
 * `width`, so the webview reports a natural size of 0. Only a load error marks
 * an icon broken.
