 *
 * One thing the site had to do is gone. It fetched each excerpt over the

 * Here the index is on disk, so Rust returns the words with the hit and a row is

 * No horizontal padding: a list with straight sides of its own wants a
 * highlighted row to run full width. Only a dropdown inside a card needs a side
 * gutter, and it adds one below.
 *
 * The height is bounded by the viewport as well as by a row count: on a short
 * window a fixed `max-h` runs off the bottom, where it cannot be scrolled to.
