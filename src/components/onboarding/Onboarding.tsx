/**
 * The first launch.
 *
 * Six screens: a welcome, the Houdini to read, F1, Houdini MCP, telemetry, and
 * what a beta is. Every screen carries a default, and Enter takes the default and moves
 * on — a reader in a hurry holds Enter and lands in the app with the settings
 * this project recommends.
 *
 * Nothing here decides anything on its own. The build is `select_install`, the
 * hook is `hook_current_build`, and the two answers are rows of
 * `user.settings` — the same calls the sidebar and the settings make.
 * See spec: Onboarding on First Launch.
