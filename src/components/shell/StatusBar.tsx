/**
 * The strip along the bottom: the three keys worth knowing, and the address
 * Houdini reaches the app on.
 *
 * The keys are stated rather than discovered. A desktop reader who learns
 * ⌘K once never opens the search field with the pointer again, and the row
 * costs nothing — it is the space under the content, which is empty anyway.
 *
 * The index pass is not here. It shows on the build card, beside the counts
 * it changes, where the reader already looks.
