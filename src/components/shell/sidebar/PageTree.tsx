/**
 * The documentation, as one list.
 *
 * Everything opens IN PLACE. A group opens onto its branches, a branch onto its
 * folders, a folder onto the folders and pages inside it, and none of it
 * replaces what is above it — the reader never loses the path they came in by,
 * and one scrollbar covers the whole tree. An earlier version swapped the
 * panel's contents for the branch you picked and gave you a back arrow to undo
 * it; that turned every look sideways into two clicks and a lost position.
 *
 * One at a time at every level. Two groups open at once, or two folders, puts
 * two lists of near-identical node names on screen and the indent is the only
 * thing telling them apart.
 *
 * The folders inside a branch are the index's, worked out when the build is
 * read — see `place.rs`. This file draws them and decides nothing about them.
 *
 * The list is windowed. A branch of twelve hundred rows costs a second of
 * layout on the click that opens it, and pays that cost again on every scroll,
 * if all of it is in the DOM. Windowing is also why the headers that must stay
 * on screen — every open row above the reader — are drawn OVER the list rather
 * than stuck to it: a windowed row rides on a transform, and a transform is
 * what `position: sticky` measures against, so a sticky row inside the window
 * sticks to the wrong box.
