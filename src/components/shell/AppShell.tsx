/**
 * The window: a title bar, a panel, and whatever is being read.
 *
 * Both routes render inside this, so the panel and the bar do not remount when
 * the reader opens a page — the tree keeps the branches they opened, and the
 * window keeps its scroll.
 *
 * The shell owns the window's height and never scrolls. Only the content
 * column does, which is what keeps the bar at the top and the keys at the
 * bottom no matter how long a page is.
