/**
 * Every glyph the app chrome draws, in one place.
 *
 * The shell never imports an icon package directly. It asks for a ROLE —
 * `Icons.bookmark`, `Icons.back` — so swapping the drawing behind a role is an
 * edit to this file and to nothing else. A role that lucide already draws well
 * is an alias; a role lucide has no honest match for (the Windows caption
 * buttons, which must be the OS shapes and not a rounded-cap approximation) is
 * drawn here.
 *
 * Sizes are NOT set here. A role is used at 10px in a tree row and at 15px in a
 * list row, so the caller states the size and this file states the shape.
