//! Reads the Houdini help out of an install on this machine.
//!
//! The crate owns the whole read: it finds the installs, reads a page out of a
//! zip, parses the markup with `wiki`, fills the FTS5 index and ranks a search.
//! It knows nothing about a window, a command or a client — the Tauri app and
//! the Python module are two callers of the same code.
//!
//! No documentation content lives here. Every page comes from the reader's own
//! install.
